# GraphGenerator

GraphGenerator is a progressive Java based GUI interface for visualizing graphs and exploring out different methods for drawing graphs (spring-based, linear algebra, etc.)

We will also be coming up with ways of generating random planar graphs. Ultimately the goal is to be able to generate good examples for graph algorithms using our interface.


## Recent Change
08/25: Implemented Rejection Sampling procedure for Kruskal algorithm to accept only the graphs that satisfies certain score threshold
